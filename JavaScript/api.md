# Application Programming Interface

## General

- APIs are interfaces for code/computers to interact with one another.
  - While humans use a visual interface (HTML), computers process APIs to obtain information.
  - APIs respond with data in formats like XML and JSON.
  - **XML**:  Extended markup language.
    - XML is syntactically similar to HTML, but it does not describe presentation or structure.
    - XML encodes information as key-value pairs structured as a key tag with values nested inside.
  - **JSON**:  JavaScript object notation.
    - JSON is syntactically the same as pure JavaScript object syntax except "keys" require quotes.
    - JSON encodes information as traditional key-value pairs nested in layers of objects.

- AJAX
  - AJAX stands for asynchronous JavaScript and XML.
  - Utility:  AJAX allows for making changes to pages without reloading.
    - Pre-built HTML fragments (including whole pages)
    - Data retrieved from elsewhere on the server
    - Data from anywhere
    
- XHR
  - XHR stands for XMLHttpRequest.  XHR is an API in the form of an object that transfers data between a web browser and a web server.
    - The object is provided by the browser's JavaScript environment.
    - Retrieval of data from XHR for continuous modifying a loaded web page is the underlying concept of AJAX.
